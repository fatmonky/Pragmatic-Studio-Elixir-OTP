# Servy - the web server built with Elixir and OTP

This is my code-along with [Pragmatic Studio's Elixir course](https://pragmaticstudio.com/courses/elixir). No Gen AI, just plain vanilla coding-along (with my own mistakes); see commit history for details. 

## Installation (auto-generated instructions with mix)

If [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/docs/publish), the package can be installed
by adding `servy` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:servy, "~> 0.1.0"}
  ]
end
```

Documentation can be generated with [ExDoc](https://github.com/elixir-lang/ex_doc)
and published on [HexDocs](https://hexdocs.pm). Once published, the docs can
be found at <https://hexdocs.pm/servy>.
